[Vuex Intro Guide](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)

Global Application State should live outside in Vuex and not in the app
This will simplify the complexity of passing props down and event up.

```bash
vue add vuex
```

::: tip TASK
add vuex to our Project
create my favorite movie feature
Every time you click on the favorite button, a movie should be added to you favorites list.
