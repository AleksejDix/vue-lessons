# Dynamic Forms

## Background

With Vue, the way you use state is via a special property called `data`.
Here's a simple example of what that looks like:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      counter: 0,
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      counter++
    },
  },
}
```

`data` must be a function which return an object with reactive data.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we're going to say that this username input only accepts
lower-case characters. So if someone types an upper-case character, that's
invalid input and we'll show an error message.

If we want our form to be dynamic, we'll need a few things:

1. Component state to store the dynamic values (an error message in our case)
2. A change handler on the input so we know what the value is as the user
   changes it and can update the error state.

Once we have that wired up then we can render the error message and disable the
submit button if there's an error.

ðŸ’° This one's a little more tricky, so I'll be around to help you with some code
samples.
