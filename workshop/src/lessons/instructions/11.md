# Provide Inject

Composition API gives us a new way of writing components. We can create parent child relation without writing any props or attributes.

[docs provide inject](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-provide-inject.html#provide-inject)


for example we can create HTML Like structure to hide the vue login from the template

In this lesson we will create a simple accordion with provide inject

[vue use](https://vueuse.org/)

## Exercise

In this exercise, we have to create a structure like this where Question will provide context and QuestionTitle and QuestionAnswer will inject it.

Context can be for example isOpen. When user clicks on the title Answer should open.
Answers are hidden by default. you can use v-show to hide and show the items.

As a bonus try to add transition to the accordion items when they show up.
