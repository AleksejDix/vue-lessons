# Basic Forms

## Background

In Vue, there actually aren't a ton of things you have to learn to interact
with forms beyond what you can do with regular DOM APIs and JavaScript. Which I
think is pretty awesome.

You can attach a submit handler to a form element with the `@submit` event listener. This
will be called with the submit event which has a `target`. That `target` is a
reference to the `<form>` DOM node which has a reference to the elements of the
form which can be used to get the values out of the form!

## Exercise

In this exercise, we have form where you can submit a username and you'll get an
"alert" when you do showing what you typed.

You can get the username by

index `event.target[0].value`

or the root element of the component

You cave to use a `.prevent` event modifier to prevent form submission

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ using refs

Another way to get the value is via a `ref` in Vue. A `ref` is an object that
stays consistent between renders of your React component.

So if you create an `ref` prop, you could access the
value via: `this.$refs[<YOURNAME>]`

Try to get the username Input's value using a ref or el.
