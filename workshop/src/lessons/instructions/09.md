# Watched Property

Vue does provide a more generic way to observe and react to data changes on a Vue instance with watch propertie.

Sometimes we need to trigger side effects when data changes in this case we can use watch property

You might need this when you want to log something or request data from some api

[watch](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#watch)

## Exercise

log a message to the console when we will have 0 or 10 items in the array

When 0 it should log `empty`
When 10 it should log `full`

add key listener `enter` to the button
