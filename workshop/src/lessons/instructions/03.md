# Vue Hallo World

## Exercise

Let's convert this to use Vue!

In modern applications you'll get Vue file from a "package
registry" like [npm](https://npmjs.com) ([vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue).
But for these first exercises, we'll use the script files which are available on [cdn.jsdelivr.net](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net) and regular script tags so you don't have to bother installing them. So in the exercise you'll be required to add script tag for this file.

Once you include the script tag, you'll have one new global variable to use:
`Vue`.

Here's a simple example of the API:

```javascript
const app = new Vue({
  el: 'SOME CSS SELECTOR',
  // your code here
})
```

Alright! Let's do this!

## Extra Credit

See if you can figure out how to mount your Vue with another method to the DOM wihotut using the `el` property
