# Rendering Arrays

## Background

One of the more tricky things with Vue is the requirement of a `key` prop when
you attempt to render a list of elements.

If we want to render a list like this, then there's no problem:

```html
<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li v-for="item in list" :key="UNIQUE">One</li>
</ul>
```

If you shuffle that list, Vue doesn't really know whether
you added an item in the middle, beginning, or end. And the same goes for when
you remove an item (it doesn't know whether that happened in the middle,
beginning, or end either). Vue needs `key` to keep track of the list item

In this example, it's not a big deal, because Vue's best-guess is right and it
works out ok. However, if any of those Vue elements represent a component that
is maintaining state, that can be pretty problematic, which this exercise
demonstrates.

## Exercise

In this exercice we will create a list of fruits where we can add new fruits and remove eaten fruits
